00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,400
This is the demonstration of Game Controller(VR compatible)

2
00:00:04,424 --> 00:00:08,824
I am using the controller with my both hand.

3
00:00:08,848 --> 00:00:13,648
The controller i made is connected with a Micro-controller(Arduino UNO).

4
00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:16,872
The uno is connected with the buttons and sensors.

5
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,896
Uno sends the serial data with the help of bluetooth module.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,720
There is another Micro Controller connected with my PC.

7
00:00:23,744 --> 00:00:25,744
That is Arduino-Pro -Micro.

8
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:30,868
The pro micro recievs the serial data(using another bluetooth module) sent from the  controller.

9
00:00:30,892 --> 00:00:35,992
The buttons of the controller works like a keyboard and a Gyro sensor works as mouse.

10
00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:39,016
The Gyro sensor is placed infront of the Controller.

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,040
In that way the player can Aim at the perfect positon.

12
00:00:42,064 --> 00:00:45,064
The VR box is used for sharing The screen of PC.

13
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:48,288
In the video I am using a cable to Power-Up the controller.

14
00:00:48,312 --> 00:00:51,712
But it can be Replaced with a Power-Bank or 5v battery.

15
00:00:51,736 --> 00:00:55,836
The device is Totally wireless, so that a player can easily move around and play the game.

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,660
It will feel like player is inside the game.

17
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:02,384
The device is very cheap and very simple  comparing with other device on market.

18
00:01:02,408 --> 00:01:04,408
Thanks for watching the video.
